# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my repository for **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)**!  
Here, I solve daily coding challenges that test problem-solving and programming skills, all while getting into the festive holiday spirit. 🎅✨

## 📚 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of daily coding puzzles released every December leading up to Christmas. It's a great way to:
- Improve programming skills 🖥️
- Practice algorithms and data structures 📈
- Challenge yourself and have fun! 🎉

## 🚀 Project Structure
Each day's solution is organized into its own folder, with separate files for code and inputs.

```
adventOfCode/
├── day_1/
│   ├── helper.go       # Helper functions for solving the problems
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── part1.go        # Solution for Part 1 of Day 1
│   └── part2.go        # Solution for Part 2 of Day 1
├── day_2/
│   ├── helper.go       # Helper functions for solving the problems
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 2
│   ├── part1.go        # Solution for Part 1 of Day 2
│   └── part2.go        # Solution for Part 2 of Day 2
...
```

## 🛠️ Languages and Tools

I primarily use **Go (Golang)** to learn and practice the language, appreciating its performance and simplicity 🚀

## 🏗️ Build and Run

To run the solutions, simply execute the `main.go` file, which will run the respective day's solutions.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashleefr/adventOfCode.git
   cd adventOfCode
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

This will execute the code and print the results for the day’s puzzles. You can modify the `main.go` file to run specific days as needed.
