# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** repository!  
Here, I tackle daily coding puzzles that enhance problem-solving skills, all amidst the festive holiday cheer. 🎅✨

## 📚 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event presenting a series of coding challenges released daily in December until Christmas. It's a wonderful opportunity to:
- Enhance programming skills 🖥️
- Master algorithms and data structures 📈
- Challenge yourself and enjoy the process! 🎉

## 🚀 Project Structure
Each day's solution resides in its own directory, complete with code and input files.

```
adventOfCode/
├── day_1/
│   ├── helper.go       # Utility functions for puzzle solving
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── part1.go        # Solution for Part 1 of Day 1
│   └── part2.go        # Solution for Part 2 of Day 1
├── day_2/
│   ├── helper.go       # Utility functions for puzzle solving
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 2
│   ├── part1.go        # Solution for Part 1 of Day 2
│   └── part2.go        # Solution for Part 2 of Day 2
...
```

## 🛠️ Languages and Tools

I predominantly utilize **Go (Golang)** for its efficiency and straightforwardness. 🚀

## 🏗️ Build and Run

To execute the solutions, simply run the `main.go` file, which processes the solutions for all days.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashleefr/adventOfCode.git
   cd adventOfCode
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

This will execute the solutions and display the results for the puzzles of the day.
